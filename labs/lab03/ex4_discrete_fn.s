.globl f # this allows other files to find the function f

# f takes in two arguments:
# a0 is the value we want to evaluate f at
# a1 is the address of the "output" array (read the lab spec for more information).
# The return value should be stored in a0
f:
    # Your code here
    addi t0 a0 3 # t0 holds the index to the array
    slli t0 t0 2 # calculate the offset 
    add t0 a1 t0 # calculate the memory addr
    lw a0 0(t0)
    # This is how you return from a function. You'll learn more about this later.
    # This should be the last line in your program.
